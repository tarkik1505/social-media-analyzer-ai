# Social Media Analytics with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model

This project presents a social media analytics chatbot powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model built using Langflow and DataStax.

## Project Overview

The solution tackles the challenge of efficiently analyzing large volumes of social media engagement data. It offers the following functionalities:

* **Efficient Data Retrieval:** Leverages DataStax's high-performance database for fast retrieval of relevant data from mock social media accounts.
* **Seamless Natural Language Interaction:** Enables users to interact with the chatbot using natural language queries through Langflow.
* **Interactive Visualization:** Provides clear and insightful data visualization using Langflow, making trends and patterns easily identifiable.

## Benefits

This project benefits social media managers by:

* **Simplifying data retrieval and analysis:** Enables quick access to valuable insights through natural language queries.
* **Empowering data-driven decisions:** Provides concrete data analysis to support informed social media strategies and campaigns.
* **Improving accessibility and efficiency:** Makes data analysis more accessible and efficient for teams.

## Technical Details

* **Model Architecture:** Employs a RAG model, combining efficient data retrieval with powerful natural language generation capabilities.
* **Challenge:** Ensuring accurate mapping between natural language queries and the complex schema of engagement data in DataStax.
* **Solution:** Implemented a custom mapping layer within Langflow to translate user queries into precise database queries using defined intents and entity recognition patterns.

## Outcomes

* **Accurate Query Results:** Achieved accurate query results through iterative testing and refinement, enhancing user experience.
* **User-Friendly Interaction:** Natural language interaction via Langflow makes data analysis intuitive and accessible.
